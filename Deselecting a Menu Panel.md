# Deselecting a Menu Panel

Skribisto has the ability to have menu panels on the right and left side. 
The left side has the default setting showing the Navigation and Favorites toolbox.
The right side has the default setting showing the Edit Text, Share, and Properties toolboxes. 

## Hiding the Toolboxes
1. Each toolbox has an arrow at the top of the title bar. 
2. Click the arrow and the toolboxes become hidden, only allowing the writing pane to display.
